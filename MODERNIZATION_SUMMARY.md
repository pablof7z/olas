# Olas App Modernization Summary

## Overview
The Olas app has been modernized to match the architectural patterns used in NutsackiOS and Ambulando, following current NDKSwift best practices.

## Key Changes

### 1. Architecture Updates
- **NostrManager**: New centralized manager using `@Observable` instead of `ObservableObject`
- **Environment Injection**: Using `@Environment(NostrManager.self)` instead of passing NDK through AppState
- **Simplified AppState**: Now only handles UI state, not NDK management

### 2. Authentication Flow
- Integrated with `NDKAuthManager` for session persistence
- Support for biometric authentication
- Proper session management with keychain storage

### 3. Data Sources
- Created declarative data sources following NDKSwift patterns:
  - `UserProfileDataSource`: For user profile metadata
  - `ImageFeedDataSource`: For image posts
  - `HashtagFeedDataSource`: For hashtag-based feeds
  - `UserPostsDataSource`: For user-specific posts

### 4. Relay Management
- Modern relay management with UserDefaults persistence
- Support for default and user-added relays
- Real-time relay status monitoring

### 5. Blossom Integration
- `BlossomServerManager` for handling file uploads
- Multi-server support with fallback
- Server selection persistence

## Files Modified

### Core Files
- `OlasApp.swift`: Updated to initialize managers
- `AppState.swift`: Simplified to UI state only
- `NostrManager.swift`: New modern manager (created)
- `BlossomServerManager.swift`: Blossom integration (created)
- `NostrDataSources.swift`: Declarative data sources (created)

### View Updates
- `ContentView.swift`: Uses new architecture
- `AuthenticationView.swift`: Uses NostrManager
- `MainTabView.swift`: Updated navigation
- `RelayManagementView.swift`: Modern relay management
- `OnboardingView.swift`: Updated authentication

## Remaining Work

While the core architecture has been modernized, some views still need updates to use the new NostrManager instead of accessing NDK through AppState. The compilation errors indicate these areas need attention:

1. Update all views that reference `appState.ndk` to use `nostrManager.ndk`
2. Fix platform-specific code (UIKit references)
3. Update relay constants

## Benefits

1. **Better State Management**: Clear separation between UI state and Nostr state
2. **Session Persistence**: Automatic session restoration on app launch
3. **Modern Patterns**: Uses latest Swift concurrency and observation patterns
4. **Consistent Architecture**: Matches other example apps in the repository
